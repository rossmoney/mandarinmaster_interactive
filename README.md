mandarinmaster_interactive
==========================

A few examples from the MandarinMaster project, a Work In Progress. Examples of JSON use. Custom written framework.

An interactive website to teach Mandarin. Featuring interactive activities to aid learning.
Interactivity supplied with JQuery and AJAX.

Some code missing for confidentiality. Main file includes/bootstrap.php basically pulls the 
component blocks together with the level data stored in /levels as json files to form the levels.

This allows the reuse of components for other activities.
